Content

Code

-> active-learning

-> full-supervision-learning

The folders contain the experimental code. The deep learning experiments were realised using Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab.

Data

-> Cycling-Dialogues contains the original dataset and the terms of use.

-> "dataset-preprocessed.pkl" is a preprocessed file which enriches the original dataset with preprocessed text (title and text were concatenated, tokenized and lowercased). This file is used for running the traditional machine learning experiments.

Results

-> An empty folder in which models are stored (after running the code for full supervision baselines).
